1. In the **Summary** step of the tool, review your options and then click the **Import** button.

    ![Data Migration Tool - Summary](../media/04-dmt_summary.png)

1. Wait for the import process to complete.

    ![Data Migration Tool - Progress](../media/04-dmt_progress.png)

    > You will know that the tool has run successfully once it has transferred 50000 records and the progress bar's animation ends. This step can take two to five minutes.

    ![Data Migration Tool - Results](../media/04-dmt_results.png)

1. Once the import process has completed, close the Azure Cosmos DB Data Migration Tool.

## Executing Simple Queries

The Azure Cosmos DB Data Explorer allows you to view documents and run queries directly within the Azure Portal. In this exercise, you will use the Data Explorer to query the data stored in our collection.*

### Validate Imported Data

*First, you will validate that the data was successfully imported into your collection using the **Documents** view in the **Data Explorer**.*

1. Return to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Resource groups** link.

    ![Resource groups](../media/04-resource_groups.png)

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **LABQURY** *Resource Group*.

    ![Lab resource group](../media/04-lab_resource_group.png)

1. In the **LABQURY** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

    ![Cosmos resource](../media/04-cosmos_resource.png)

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and click the **Data Explorer** link on the left side of the blade.

    ![Data Explorer pane](../media/04-data_explorer_pane.png)

1. In the **Data Explorer** section, expand the **UniversityDatabase** database node and then expand the **StudentCollection** collection node. 

    ![Collection node](../media/04-collection_node.png)

1. Within the **StudentCollection** node, click the **Documents** link to view a subset of the various documents in the collection. Select a few of the documents and observe the properties and structure of the documents.

    ![Documents](../media/04-documents.png)

    ![Example document](../media/04-example_document.png)

### Executing a Simple SELECT Queries

*You will now use the query editor in the **Data Explorer** to execute a few simple SELECT queries using SQL syntax.*

1. Click the **New SQL Query** button at the top of the **Data Explorer** section.

    ![New SQL query](../media/04-new_query.png)

1. In the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2017
    ```

    > This first query will select all properties from all documents in the collection where the students where enrolled in 2017. You will notice that we are using the alias ``s`` to refer to the collection.

    ![Query editor](../media/04-query_editor.png)

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. 

    ![Execute query](../media/04-execute_query.png)

1. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

    ![Query results](../media/04-query_results.png)

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM students WHERE students.enrollmentYear = 2017
    ```

    > In this query, we drop the ``s`` alias and use the ``students`` source. When we execute this query, we should see the same results as the previous query.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM arbitraryname WHERE arbitraryname.enrollmentYear = 2017
    ```

    > In this query, we will prove that the name used for the source can be any name you choose. We will use the name ``arbitraryname`` for the source. When we execute this query, we should see the same results as the previous query.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT s.studentAlias FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2017
    ```

    > Going back to ``s`` as an alias, we will now create a query where we only select the ``studentAlias`` property and return the value of that property in our result set.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT VALUE s.studentAlias FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2017
    ```

    > In some scenarios, you may need to return a flattened array as the result of your query. This query uses the ``VALUE`` keyword to flatten the array by taking the single returned (string) property and creating a string array.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

### Implicitly Executing a Cross-Partition Query

*The Data Explorer will allow you to create a cross-partition query without the need to manually configure any settings. You will now use the query editor in the Data Explorer to perform single or multi-partition queries*

1. Back in the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2016 
    ```

    > Since we know that our partition key is ``/enrollmentYear``, we know that any query that targets a single valid value for the ``enrollmentYear`` property will be a single partition query.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

    > Observe the Request Charge (in RU/s) for the executed query.

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM students s
    ```

    > If we want to execute a blanket query that will fan-out to all partitions, we simply can drop our ``WHERE`` clause that filters on a single valid value for our partition key path.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

    > Observe the Request Charge (in RU/s) for the executed query. You will notice that the charge is relatively greater for this query.

1. Back in the query tab, replace the contents of the *query editor* with the following SQL query:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear IN (2015, 2016, 2017)
    ```

    > Observe the Request Charge (in RU/s) for the executed query. You will notice that the charge is greater than a single partition but far less than a fan-out across all partitions.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

    > Observe the Request Charge (in RU/s) for the executed query.

### Use Built-In Functions

*There are a large variety of built-in functions available in the SQL query syntax for the SQL API in Azure Cosmos DB. We will focus on a single function in this task but you can learn more about the others here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sql-query-reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/sql-api-sql-query-reference#bk_built_in_functions)*

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT s.studentAlias FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2015
    ```

    > Our goal is to get the school-issued e-mail address for all students who enrolled in 2015. We can issue a simple query to start that will return the login alias for each student.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT CONCAT(s.studentAlias, '@contoso.edu') AS email FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2015
    ```

    > To get the school-issued e-mail address, we will need to concatenate the ``@contoso.edu`` string to the end of each alias. We can perform this action using the ``CONCAT`` built-in function.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT VALUE CONCAT(s.studentAlias, '@contoso.edu') FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2015
    ```

    > In most client-side applications, you likely would only need an array of strings as opposed to an array of objects. We can use the ``VALUE`` keyword here to flatten our result set.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

### Projecting Query Results

*In some use cases, we may need to reshape the structure of our result JSON array to a structure that our libraries or third-party APIs can parse. We will focus on a single query and re-shape the results into various formats using the native JSON capabilities in the SQL query syntax.*

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT 
        CONCAT(s.firstName, " ", s.lastName), 
        s.academicStatus.warning, 
        s.academicStatus.suspension, 
        s.academicStatus.expulsion,
        s.enrollmentYear,
        s.projectedGraduationYear
    FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2014
    ```

    > In this first query, we want to determine the current status of every student who enrolled in 2014. Our goal here is to eventually have a flattened, simple-to-understand view of every student and their current academic status.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

    > You will quickly notice that the value representing the name of the student, using the ``CONCAT`` function, has a placeholder property name instead of a simple string.

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT 
        CONCAT(s.firstName, " ", s.lastName) AS name, 
        s.academicStatus.warning, 
        s.academicStatus.suspension, 
        s.academicStatus.expulsion,
        s.enrollmentYear,
        s.projectedGraduationYear
    FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2014
    ```

    > We will update our previous query by naming our property that uses a built-in function.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT {
        "name": CONCAT(s.firstName, " ", s.lastName), 
        "isWarned": s.academicStatus.warning, 
        "isSuspended": s.academicStatus.suspension, 
        "isExpelled": s.academicStatus.expulsion,
        "enrollment": {
            "start": s.enrollmentYear,
            "end": s.projectedGraduationYear
        }
    } AS studentStatus
    FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2014
    ```

    > Another alternative way to specify the structure of our JSON document is to use the curly braces from JSON. At this point, we are defining the structure of the JSON result directly in our query. 

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

    > You should notice that our JSON object is still "wrapped" in another JSON object. Essentially, we have an array of the parent type with a property named ``studentStatus`` that contains the actual data we want.

1. In the *query editor*, replace the current query with the following query:

    ```sql
    SELECT VALUE {
        "name": CONCAT(s.firstName, " ", s.lastName), 
        "isWarned": s.academicStatus.warning, 
        "isSuspended": s.academicStatus.suspension, 
        "isExpelled": s.academicStatus.expulsion,
        "enrollment": {
            "start": s.enrollmentYear,
            "end": s.projectedGraduationYear
        }
    } FROM students s WHERE s.enrollmentYear = 2014
    ```

    > If we want to "unwrap" our JSON data and flatten to a simple array of like-structured objects, we need to use the ``VALUE`` keyword.

1. Click the **Execute Query** button in the query tab to run the query. In the **Results** pane, observe the results of your query.

## Use .NET SDK to Query Azure Cosmos DB



### Create a .NET Core Project

**

1. On your local machine, create a new folder that will be used to contain the content of your .NET Core project.

1. In the new folder, right-click the folder and select the **Open with Code** menu option.

    ![Open with Visual Studio Code](../media/04-open_with_code.png)

    > Alternatively, you can run a command prompt in your current directory and execute the ``code .`` command.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window that appears, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

    ![Open in Command Prompt](../media/04-open_command_prompt.png)

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet new console --output .
    ```

    > This command will create a new .NET Core 2.1 project. The project will be a **console** project and the project will be created in the current directly since you used the ``--output .`` option.

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core --version 1.9.1
    ```

    > This command will add the ``Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core`` NuGet package as a project dependency.

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    ```

    > This command will restore all packages specified as dependencies in the project.

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```

    > This command will build the project.

1. Click the **🗙** symbol to close the terminal pane.

1. Observe the **Program.cs** and **vscodetemple.csproj** files created by the .NET Core CLI.

    ![Project files](../media/04-project_files.png)

1. Double-click the **Program.cs** link in the **Explorer** pane to open the file in the editor.

    ![Open editor](../media/04-program_editor.png)

### Create DocumentClient Instance

**

1. Within the **Program.cs** editor tab, Add the following using blocks to the top of the editor:

    ```c#
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Documents;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Client;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Linq;
    ```

1. Locate the **Program** class and replace it with the following class:

    ```c#
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {         
        }

        private static async Task ExecuteLogic(DocumentClient client)
        {
        }
    }
    ```

1. Within the **Program** class, add the following lines of code to create variables for your connection information:

    ```c#
    private static readonly Uri _endpointUri = new Uri("");
    private static readonly string _primaryKey = "";
    private static readonly string _databaseId = "UniversityDatabase";
    private static readonly string _collectionId = "StudentCollection";  
    ```

1. For the ``_endpointUri`` variable, replace the placeholder value with the **URI** value from your Azure Cosmos DB account that you recorded earlier in this lab: 

    > For example, if your **uri** is ``https://labqury.documents.azure.com:443/``, your new variable assignment will look like this: ``private static readonly Uri _endpointUri = new Uri("https://labqury.documents.azure.com:443/");``.

1. For the ``_primaryKey`` variable, replace the placeholder value with the **PRIMARY KEY** value from your Azure Cosmos DB account that you recorded earlier in this lab: 

    > For example, if your **primary key** is ``NAye14XRGsHFbhpOVUWB7CMG2MOTAigdei5eNjxHNHup7oaBbXyVYSLW2lkPGeKRlZrCkgMdFpCEnOjlHpz94g==``, your new variable assignment will look like this: ``private static readonly string _primaryKey = "NAye14XRGsHFbhpOVUWB7CMG2MOTAigdei5eNjxHNHup7oaBbXyVYSLW2lkPGeKRlZrCkgMdFpCEnOjlHpz94g==";``.
    
1. Locate the **Main** method:

    ```c#
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    { 
    }
    ```

1. Within the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to author a using block that creates and disposes a **DocumentClient** instance:

    ```c#
    using (DocumentClient client = new DocumentClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
    {
        
    }
    ```

1. Within the *using* block, add the following line of code to call the static ``ExecuteLogic`` method passing in the ``DocumentClient`` instance and waiting for the asynchronous execution to complete.

    ```c#
    ExecuteLogic(client).Wait();
    ```

1. Your ``Program`` class definition should now look like this:

    ```c#
    public class Program
    { 
        private static readonly Uri _endpointUri = new Uri("<your uri>");
        private static readonly string _primaryKey = "<your key>";
        private static readonly string _databaseId = "UniversityDatabase";
        private static readonly string _collectionId = "StudentCollection";  

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {    
            using (DocumentClient client = new DocumentClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
            {
                ExecuteLogic(client).Wait();
            }
        }

        private static async Task ExecuteLogic(DocumentClient client)
        {       
        }
    }
    ```

    > We are now going to implement a sample query to make sure our client connection code works.

1. Locate the **ExecuteLogic** method:

    ```c#
    private static async Task ExecuteLogic(DocumentClient client)
    {       
    }

    ```    

1. Within the **ExecuteLogic** method, add the following line of code to create a variable named ``collectionLink`` that references the *self-link* Uri for the collection:

    ```c#
    Uri collectionLink = UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(_databaseId, _collectionId);
    ```

1. Add the following line of code to create a string variable named ``sql`` that contains a sample SQL query:

    ```c#
    IQueryable<StudentProfile> query = client.CreateDocumentQuery<StudentProfile>(collectionLink, new SqlQuerySpec(sql));  
    ```

    Replace that code with the following code:

    ```c#
    IDocumentQuery<StudentProfile> query = client.CreateDocumentQuery<StudentProfile>(collectionLink, new SqlQuerySpec(sql), new FeedOptions { MaxItemCount = 100 }).AsDocumentQuery();
    ```

    > The DocumentQuery class will allow us to determine if there are more results available and page through results.

1. Locate the following lines of code:

    ```c#
    foreach(StudentProfile profile in query)
    {
        Console.Out.WriteLine($"[{profile.Id}]\t{profile.Name,-20}\t{profile.Email.School,-50}\t{profile.Email.Home}");
