## Setup

Before starting any lab in this workshop, you will need to create the various Azure resources necessary to complete the lab. In this exercise, you will create an Azure Cosmos DB account, database and collection and then populate the collection with a collection of JSON documents.

### Download Required Files

*A JSON file has been provided that will contain a collection 50,000 students. You will use this file later to import documents into your collection.*

1. Download the transactions.json file to your local machine by right clicking on [this link](../files/transactions.json) and selecting 'save target as' or 'save link as' depending on your browser.

### Create Azure Cosmos DB Assets

*You will now create an Azure Cosmos DB account to use in this lab.*

1. In a new window, sign in to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>).

1. On the left side of the portal, click the **Create a resource** link.

    ![Create a resource](../media/06-create_a_resource.png)

1. At the top of the **New** blade, locate the **Search the Marketplace** field.

    ![Search the Marketplace](../media/06-search_the_marketplace.png)

1. Enter the text **Cosmos** into the search field and press **Enter**.

    ```

    > This command will create a new .NET Core 2.1 project. The project will be a **console** project and the project will be created in the current directly since you used the ``--output .`` option.

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core --version 1.9.1
    ```

    > This command will add the [Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB.Core/) NuGet package as a project dependency.

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet add package Bogus --version 22.0.7
    ```

    > This command will add the [Bogus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bogus/) NuGet package as a project dependency.

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet restore
    ```

    > This command will restore all packages specified as dependencies in the project.

1. In the terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```

    > This command will build the project.

1. Click the **ðŸ—™** symbol to close the terminal pane.

1. Observe the **Program.cs** and **vscodetemple.csproj** files created by the .NET Core CLI.

    ![Project files](../media/06-project_files.png)

1. Double-click the **Program.cs** link in the **Explorer** pane to open the file in the editor.

    ![Open editor](../media/06-program_editor.png)

### Create DocumentClient Instance

**

1. Within the **Program.cs** editor tab, Add the following using blocks to the top of the editor:

    ```c#
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
    using System.Linq;
    using System.Net;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Documents;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Client;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Linq;
    ```

1. Locate the **Program** class and replace it with the following class:

    ```c#
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {         
        }

        private static async Task ExecuteLogic(DocumentClient client)
        {
        }
    }
    ```

1. Within the **Program** class, add the following lines of code to create variables for your connection information:

    ```c#
    private static readonly Uri _endpointUri = new Uri("");
    private static readonly string _primaryKey = "";
    ```

1. For the ``_endpointUri`` variable, replace the placeholder value with the **URI** value from your Azure Cosmos DB account that you recorded earlier in this lab: 

    > For example, if your **uri** is ``https://labtrbl.documents.azure.com:443/``, your new variable assignment will look like this: ``private static readonly Uri _endpointUri = new Uri("https://labtrbl.documents.azure.com:443/");``.

1. For the ``_primaryKey`` variable, replace the placeholder value with the **PRIMARY KEY** value from your Azure Cosmos DB account that you recorded earlier in this lab: 

    > For example, if your **primary key** is ``yFMff7GiFN7AaGPC2WehNcgnvt8kP2EbkLnuVNWYgKoFmQ5dYyZ94cBXd8wBgV0TCKzmIO3z2y8WoRkViL2waA==``, your new variable assignment will look like this: ``private static readonly string _primaryKey = "yFMff7GiFN7AaGPC2WehNcgnvt8kP2EbkLnuVNWYgKoFmQ5dYyZ94cBXd8wBgV0TCKzmIO3z2y8WoRkViL2waA==";``.
    
1. Locate the **Main** method:

    ```c#
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    { 
    }
    ```

1. Within the **Main** method, add the following lines of code to author a using block that creates and disposes a **DocumentClient** instance:

    ```c#
    using (DocumentClient client = new DocumentClient(endpointUri, primaryKey))
    {
        
    }
    ```

1. Within the *using* block, add the following line of code to call the static ``ExecuteLogic`` method passing in the ``DocumentClient`` instance and waiting for the asynchronous execution to complete.

    ```c#
    ExecuteLogic(client).Wait();
    ```

1. Locate the **ExecuteLogic** method:

    ```c#
    private static async Task ExecuteLogic(DocumentClient client)
    {       
    }
    ```

1. Within the **ExecuteLogic** method, add the following line of code to asynchronously open a connection:

    ```c#
    await client.OpenAsync();
    ```

1. Your ``Program`` class definition should now look like this:

    ```c#
    public class Program
    { 
        private static readonly Uri _endpointUri = new Uri("<your uri>");
        private static readonly string _primaryKey = "<your key>";

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {    
            using (DocumentClient client = new DocumentClient(_endpointUri, _primaryKey))
            {
                ExecuteLogic(client).Wait();
            }
        }

        private static async Task ExecuteLogic(DocumentClient client)
        {  
            await client.OpenAsync();     
        }
    }
    ```

    > We will now execute build the application to make sure our code compiles successfully.

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```

    > This command will build the console project.

    ```c#
    public class Transaction
    {
        public double amount { get; set; }
        public bool processed { get; set; }
        public string paidBy { get; set; }
        public string costCenter { get; set; }
    }
    ```

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

    ```sh
    dotnet build
    ```

    > This command will build the console project.

1. Click the **ðŸ—™** symbol to close the terminal pane.

1. Close all open editor tabs.

1. Double-click the **Program.cs** link in the **Explorer** pane to open the file in the editor.

1. Locate the **ExecuteLogic** method and delete any existing code:

    ```c#
    private static async Task ExecuteLogic(DocumentClient client)
    {       
    }
    ```

1. Add the following code to the method to create an asynchronous connection:

    ```c#
    await client.OpenAsync();
    ```
    
1. Add the following line of code to create a variable named ``collectionLink`` that is a reference (self-link) to an existing collection:

    ```c#
    Uri collectionSelfLink = UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri("FinancialDatabase", "TransactionCollection");
    ```

1. Observe the code in the **ExecuteLogic** method.

    > For the next few instructions, we will use the **Bogus** library to create test data. This library allows you to create a collection of objects with fake data set on each object's property. For this lab, our intent is to **focus on Azure Cosmos DB** instead of this library. With that intent in mind, the next set of instructions will expedite the process of creating test data.

1. Add the following code to create a collection of ``Transaction`` instances:

    ```c#
    var transactions = new Bogus.Faker<Transaction>()
        .RuleFor(t => t.amount, (fake) => Math.Round(fake.Random.Double(5, 500), 2))
        .RuleFor(t => t.processed, (fake) => fake.Random.Bool(0.6f))
        .RuleFor(t => t.paidBy, (fake) => $"{fake.Name.FirstName().ToLower()}.{fake.Name.LastName().ToLower()}")
        .RuleFor(t => t.costCenter, (fake) => fake.Commerce.Department(1).ToLower())
        .GenerateLazy(1000);
    ```
    
1. Add the following foreach block to iterate over the ``PurchaseFoodOrBeverage`` instances:

    ```c#
    foreach(var transaction in transactions)
    {
    }
    ```

1. Within the ``foreach`` block, add the following line of code to asynchronously create a document and save the result of the creation task to a variable:

    ```c#
    ResourceResponse<Document> result = await client.CreateDocumentAsync(collectionSelfLink, transaction);
    ```

    > The ``CreateDocumentAsync`` method of the ``DocumentClient`` class takes in a self-link for a collection and an object that you would like to serialize into JSON and store as a document within the specified collection.

1. Still within the ``foreach`` block, add the following line of code to write the value of the newly created resource's ``id`` property to the console:

    ```c#
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Document Created\t{result.Resource.Id}");
    ```

    > The ``ResourceResponse`` type has a property named ``Resource`` that can give you access to interesting data about a document such as it's unique id, time-to-live value, self-link, ETag, timestamp,  and attachments.

1. Your **ExecuteLogic** method should look like this:

    ```c#
    private static async Task ExecuteLogic(DocumentClient client)
    {
        await client.OpenAsync();  
        Uri collectionSelfLink = UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri("FinancialDatabase", "TransactionCollection");
        var transactions = new Bogus.Faker<Transaction>()
            .RuleFor(t => t.amount, (fake) => Math.Round(fake.Random.Double(5, 500), 2))
            .RuleFor(t => t.processed, (fake) => fake.Random.Bool(0.6f))
            .RuleFor(t => t.paidBy, (fake) => $"{fake.Name.FirstName().ToLower()}.{fake.Name.LastName().ToLower()}")
            .RuleFor(t => t.costCenter, (fake) => fake.Commerce.Department(1).ToLower())
            .GenerateLazy(500);
        foreach(var transaction in transactions)
        {
            ResourceResponse<Document> result = await client.CreateDocumentAsync(collectionSelfLink, transaction);
            await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Document Created\t{result.Resource.Id}");
        }            
    }
    ```

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.

1. In the open terminal pane, enter and execute the following command:

        await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Document Created\t{result.Resource.Id}");
    } 
    ```

    Replace those lines of code with the following code:

    ```c#
    List<Task<ResourceResponse<Document>>> tasks = new List<Task<ResourceResponse<Document>>>();
    foreach(var transaction in transactions)
    {
        Task<ResourceResponse<Document>> resultTask = client.CreateDocumentAsync(collectionSelfLink, transaction);
        tasks.Add(resultTask);
    }    
    Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());
    foreach(var task in tasks)
    {
        await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Document Created\t{task.Result.Resource.Id}");
    }  
    ```

    > We are going to attempt to run as many of these creation tasks in parallel as possible. Remember, our collection is configured at 1,000 RU/s.

1. Your **ExecuteLogic** method should look like this:

### Managing SDK Query Options

**

1. Locate the **ExecuteLogic** method and delete any existing code:

    ```c#
    private static async Task ExecuteLogic(DocumentClient client)
    {       
    }
    ```

1. Add the following code to the method to create an asynchronous connection:

    ```c#
    await client.OpenAsync();
    ```

1. Add the following code to the method to create a self-link to an existing collection:

    ```c#
    Uri collectionSelfLink = UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri("FinancialDatabase", "TransactionCollection");
    ```

1. Add the following line of code to create a high-precision timer:

    ```c#
    Stopwatch timer = new Stopwatch();
    ```

1. Add the following lines of code to configure options for a query:

    ```c#
    FeedOptions options = new FeedOptions
    {
        EnableCrossPartitionQuery = true,
        MaxItemCount = 100,
        MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 0,
        MaxBufferedItemCount = 0
    }; 
    ```

1. Add the following lines of code to write various values to the console window:

    ```c#
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"MaxItemCount:\t{options.MaxItemCount}");
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"MaxDegreeOfParallelism:\t{options.MaxDegreeOfParallelism}");
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"MaxBufferedItemCount:\t{options.MaxBufferedItemCount}");
    ```

1. Add the following line of code that will store a SQL query in a string variable:

    ```c#
    string sql = "SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.processed = true ORDER BY c.amount DESC";
    ```

    > This query will perform a cross-partition ORDER BY on a filtered result set.

1. Add the following line of code to start the timer:

    ```c#
    timer.Start();
    ```

1. Add the following line of code to create a document query instance:

    ```c#
    IDocumentQuery<Document> query = client.CreateDocumentQuery<Document>(collectionSelfLink, sql, options).AsDocumentQuery();
    ```

1. Add the following lines of code to enumerate the result set.

    ```c#
    while (query.HasMoreResults)  
    {
        var result = await query.ExecuteNextAsync<Document>();
    }
    ```

    > Since the results are paged, we will need to call the ``ExecuteNextAsync`` method multiple times in a while loop.

1. Add the following line of code stop the timer:

    ```c#
    timer.Stop();
    ```

1. Add the following line of code to write the timer's results to the console window:

    ```c#
    await Console.Out.WriteLineAsync($"Elapsed Time:\t{timer.Elapsed.TotalSeconds}");
    ```

1. Save all of your open editor tabs.

1. In the Visual Studio Code window, right-click the **Explorer** pane and select the **Open in Command Prompt** menu option.
